          "In this two-semester course, Georgia Tech students collaborated to transform a 2nd Grade Literacy Web Application into a mobile app using the Corona 2D game engine and Solar2DLabs. Emphasis was on meticulous documentation, including iteration plans, visual prototypes, design, UML diagrams, and detailed design documents. The Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program promoted interdisciplinary collaboration, offering undergraduates academic credits and providing faculty and graduate students with design and research opportunities.",
          "This introductory course for the Media Thread at Georgia Tech lays the foundation for syntax-related knowledge in p5.js, processing, and GPU programming (GLSL). Notable for its 3D creative animation project within a p5.js environment, the course assumes no prior graphics experience. Covering fundamental topics like output devices, transformations, and hidden surfaces, it requires only basic linear algebra and computer programming skills. The syllabus extends to GPU programming, ray tracing, polyhedral models, and student-chosen topics toward the course's conclusion.",
          "This course integrates design and HCI evaluation, exploring topics such as perception, sound physics, filters, synthesis, and HCI. Students engage in requirements gathering, participatory design, prototyping, and design refinement based on user feedback. The curriculum delves into the significance of audio in human-computer interaction, its appropriateness across applications, and effective integration into interfaces. Tailored for frontend developers incorporating audio aspects, the course addresses critical questions, including the importance of audio in HCI and strategies for its effective use in interfaces.",
          "In this course, I applied knowledge from previous courses to diverse projects, representing the culmination of my academic journey. Unfortunately, this marks the final year of the course at Georgia Tech, potentially leaving no records. Computational aesthetics, vital in societal and economic contexts, prompts students to devise and test beautification algorithms for colors, music, animations, and more.",
          "This course provides a concise introduction to essential machine learning techniques, emphasizing practical algorithms and their real-world applications. It covers foundational mathematical concepts, including linear algebra, probability, statistics, information theory, and optimization. The exploration spans unsupervised machine learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel density estimation) and supervised learning (tree-based models, support vector machines, linear classification and regression, neural networks). The structured approach equips students with a solid foundation for applying machine learning effectively to real-world datasets.",
          "Deep Learning is a rapidly advancing set of techniques with broad applications in vision, language, speech, reasoning, and robotics. This course introduces Neural Networks (NNs) basics and explores cutting-edge research in modules covering background, Convolutional NNs, Recurrent NNs, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Structured Prediction. Instructor lectures and practical homework reinforce theoretical concepts. A final project allows in-depth exploration of a specific Deep Learning area. For instance, my notable project involved optimizing a GANS (Generative Adversarial Model) model for colorizing grayscale images.          ",

        "MetaTunes, initiated in early 2022, stands as a venture into the NFT realm that utilized p5.js and FFT for a sound mapping effect. This unique project translates media audio input into a canvas, strategically mapping sounds to create aesthetically appealing and visually stimulating artistic representations of songs. Controlled by FFT manipulation, the resulting coloring and shapes form a dynamic representation of the song input.",
        "The MetaTunes code offers 15+ modes and diverse styles for canvas drawings. Remarkably, no two drawings are alike, ensuring each instance is a distinct visual representation of the same song. The algorithm's complexity guarantees that even with identical inputs, the images generated will always differ.",
        "Taking MetaTunes to the next level, Geometry World presents a 3D representation of music, where the world dynamically responds to the input rhythms. This real-time component introduces color changes and intricate patterns in a 3D field, illuminating the screen with captivating colors as the music plays. Unlike its predecessor, nothing is painted or stored officially; it's a real-time, ephemeral experience.",

Each rendering of the code is unique, ensuring no two portraits will ever be the same. This project marks one of my initial forays into creative coding.",
        "Elevating the concept of Portrait Planets, this project introduces rainbow super shapes generated through a coded algorithm. Super shapes, briefly defined as (describe briefly), create a diverse visual experience with no two renders ever being identical.
